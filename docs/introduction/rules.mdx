Rules let you describe how Violinist should behave when it discovers available updates. By combining conditions and actions you
can automate repetitive chores, tailor notification preferences, and keep noisy pull requests out of your repositories.

## How rules are evaluated

Violinist evaluates rules every time an update job runs. Rules are processed from top to bottom in the Rules interface, so a rule placed higher in the list can override the behaviour of the rules beneath it.

:::tip Use rule ordering to your advantage
Place broad rules (for example, "apply to every dependency") at the bottom and keep narrowly scoped rules at the top. That way
you can have default behaviour for most projects while still allowing exceptions.

## Creating a rule

1. Open the Violinist dashboard and choose **Rules** from the main navigation.
2. Click **New rule** and give it a descriptive name so you can find it later.
3. Define one or more conditions that determine when the rule should run.
4. Pick the actions Violinist should take when every condition is met.
5. Save the rule and drag it to the correct position in the rules list.

Rules can be edited at any time. Changes take effect the next time a scheduled update runs, or immediately if you trigger an
update manually from the project page.

## Available conditions

You can mix and match any of the following conditions to target exactly the updates you care about:

- **Project** – Limit the rule to specific repositories or organisations.
- **Package pattern** – Match one package or a wildcard such as `symfony/*`.
- **Dependency type** – Target only production, development, or security advisories.
- **Update type** – Restrict the rule to patch, minor, or major version bumps.
- **Default branch** – Apply rules only when the project uses a particular default branch.
- **Schedule** – Trigger the rule only for updates that run on a specific day or schedule window.
- **Status checks** – Require that a particular check has passed before the rule can continue.

Any condition left blank is treated as "match everything".

## Actions

After a rule matches, Violinist applies the selected actions in the order they are configured. Common actions include:

- **Auto merge** the pull request once all status checks pass.
- **Skip creating** a pull request when you do not want Violinist to manage that dependency.
- **Change the update schedule** by moving the update to a different cadence.
- **Adjust notification settings** such as disabling Slack alerts or sending an email summary.
- **Label or assign** the pull request so your triage workflow knows who should review the change.

You can add more than one action to a rule. For example, one rule may both re-label a PR and reschedule the update.

## Examples

### Skip nightly test packages on legacy branches

- **Conditions:** project is `company/legacy-app`, package pattern `vendor/nightly-*`, branch `legacy`.
- **Actions:** Do not create a pull request.

This keeps experimental packages out of the branch that stabilises your production deployments.

### Auto merge patch-level framework updates

- **Conditions:** package pattern `symfony/*`, update type `patch`, status checks `ci/tests` passed.
- **Actions:** Apply the `dependencies` label and enable auto merge when checks pass.

### Send security advisories to a separate channel

- **Conditions:** dependency type `security`.
- **Actions:** Disable standard notifications and send the alert to your security-specific webhook.

## Best practices

- Review your rules periodically to ensure they still reflect your workflow.
- Keep rule names descriptive—future you (and your teammates) will thank you.
- Test complex rules by triggering a manual update so you can confirm the resulting behaviour.
- Document any organisation-wide rules in your team handbook so new collaborators know what to expect.

With carefully structured rules you can let Violinist handle the routine updates while you focus on the work that matters most.
