> This information relates to the _on-prem / Self Hosted_ version, which is _not_ [violinist.io](https://violinist.io) - a SaaS providing automated update checks for Composer / PHP. This information only applies to running update runner with the on-prem / Self Hosted version.

## General information about data collected by violinist.io

For on-prem / self hosted violinist update check runners no data is ever sent to violinist.io servers. You can actively opt-in to data collection with an environment variable, but this is disabled by default.

To perform updates to projects using on-prem / self hosted update check runners, the container requires access to the source code of the projects. Access in this context means access to do a full checkout of the code repository. This access is never shared outside the container, and the checked out repository will not persist by default. Violinist.io does not need or want access to these containers, and you are free to run them on your own or any other third party infrastructure.

## Information stored by violinist for on-prem / self hosted violinist update check runners

If you choose to obtain a licence to run update checks, you might want to sign up to the website [https://violinist.io](https://violinist.io). If you do this only to obtain the licence, the following data will be stored

- Your login information (usually oAuth through one of the supported providers, which would include a username and an email)
- Your licence key (for being able to retrieve it later)

You do not need to grant access to private repositories to purchase a licence.
