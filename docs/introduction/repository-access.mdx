## General information about access

To perform updates to projects added on violinist.io we require access to the source code of the projects. Access in this context means access to do a full checkout of the code repository.

When the update jobs are being run, the full source will be checked out. This source code is not stored or cached, and the containers where the source code is checked out are destroyed and are never re-used.

## Public repositories

Public repositories are theoretically open to be accessed by anyone. However, if you want to add a public repository to violinist.io we require you to administer the repository in question. The reason for this is to avoid creating unwanted pull requests from a random user, when the administrators of a project would not want this activity themselves.

## Private repositories

Private repositories must be added by a user that has access to administer the repository. Keep in mind that when you add a repository, the user you are logged in with will also be seen as the author of pull/merge requests to this repository. For this reason, many violinist users (for example agencies) use a bot user to add their repositories to violinist.io
