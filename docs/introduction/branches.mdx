## Branch names

The branch name is named after the name of the package being updated, and the version you update from and to.

For example, if violinist finds out it wants to update your dependency psr/log from version 1.0.0 to 1.1.4 it would create the branch `psrlog100114`.

If you want your branches to be named differently, you might be interested in [specifying a branch prefix](#branch-prefix).

## Keeping the branch up to date

Violinist will try to keep the PR and its branch up to date. So if you push changes to your default branch, the PR becomes out of date. To make sure the PR can be still merged, violinist will force-push the branch to be up to date. This also means you should avoid working on a violinist branch, since your work might end up being overwritten by a force push.

If you want to add additional changes to a PR created by violinist you can start a new branch from the PR branch and work in that branch without worrying about losing your work.
