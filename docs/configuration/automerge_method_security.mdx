## Configuration

<div className="config-wrapper"><div className="config">__name__: automerge_method_security</div>
<div className="config">__type__: string</div>
<div className="config">__default__: "merge"</div></div>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
      // highlight-next-line
      "automerge_method_security": "merge"
    }
  }
}
```

Indicates which merge method should be used when using [automerge](/configuration/automerge). But in contrast to the [automerge_method](/configuration/automerge_method) option, this will allow you to have a separate method for security updates.

> Note! This option currently does not work with Bitbucket.

## Explanation

When violinist opens a merge request which enables automerge, the UI for the supported providers will allow you to select which method should be used for merging. The three options are `merge`, `rebase` or `squash`. If you leave this blank, violinist will use the default, which is `merge`.

This option will only apply to security updates, and if there is another value specified for [automerge_method](/configuration/automerge_method) then the value for `automerge_method_security` will be used if its a security update.

## Example

Many people use a `main` branch for their production environment. Say you wanted to enable automerge with all your violinist.io merge requests, but if there was a security update, you would want this to be automerged into the `main` branch. And maybe for the main branch, you are required to use `merge` as the strategy, for git history purposes. Then let's say your configuration looked something like this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
      "automerge": "1",
      "automerge_method": "squash",
    }
  }
}
```

Then, to make it use the branch `main` and the method `merge` for the security updates being created by violinist, then you would change it like this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
      "automerge": "1",
      "automerge_method": "squash",
      // highlight-start
      "default_branch_security": "main",
      "automerge_method_security": "merge"
      // highlight-end
    }
  }
}
```

If you leave this option blank (or use an invalid option value), it will use the value set for [automerge_method](/configuration/automerge_method) (if any). If no value is set for either of the options, it will use the default value which is `merge`.
