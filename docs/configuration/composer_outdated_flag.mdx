## Configuration

<div className="config-wrapper"><div className="config">__name__: composer_outdated_flag</div>
<div className="config">__type__: string</div>
<div className="config">__default__: minor</div></div>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
// highlight-next-line
      "composer_outdated_flag": "minor"
    }
  }
}
```

Control the semantic versioning level for checking outdated packages.

## Explanation

By default, Violinist uses the `composer outdated -D -m` command to check for updates, where the `-m` flag restricts checks to minor SemVer-compatible updates. The `composer_outdated_flag` option allows you to customize this behavior by specifying which level of updates you want to check for.

The option accepts three values:

- **`major`**: Check for all updates including major version changes (no restriction flag)
- **`minor`**: Check only for minor and patch updates (uses `-m` / `--minor-only` flag) - this is the default
- **`patch`**: Check only for patch-level updates (uses `-p` / `--patch-only` flag)

This setting affects how Violinist searches for available updates, which in turn determines what pull requests will be created for your project.

## Example

If you want to be more conservative and only receive pull requests for patch-level updates (bug fixes and security patches), you can configure your project like this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "description": "My production application",
  "require": {
    "vendor/package": "^2.1.0",
  },
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
// highlight-next-line
      "composer_outdated_flag": "patch"
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration, if you have version 2.1.0 installed and versions 2.1.1, 2.2.0, and 3.0.0 are available, Violinist will only create a pull request for version 2.1.1.

Conversely, if you want to receive pull requests for all updates including major version changes:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "description": "My development project",
  "require": {
    "vendor/package": "^2.1.0",
  },
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
// highlight-next-line
      "composer_outdated_flag": "major"
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration, Violinist will create pull requests for major version updates like 3.0.0, in addition to minor and patch updates.

> Note: This option can be combined with other configuration options like [check_only_direct_dependencies](/configuration/check_only_direct_dependencies), [security_updates_only](/configuration/security_updates_only), and others to fine-tune which updates you want to receive.
