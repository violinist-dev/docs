Use the Violinist configuration to fine-tune how dependency updates are discovered, grouped, and merged.
This section documents every available option so you can customize updates for your repositories.

Get started by exploring the most common areas:

- [Configuration options list](./) – browse the full set of settings in the sidebar.
- [Rules](/configuration/rules/) – group packages and override settings per group.
- [Automerge](/configuration/automerge) and [automerge security](/configuration/automerge_security) – control how updates are merged.
- [Bundled packages](/configuration/bundled_packages) – manage updates that should be handled together.

Looking for a specific option? Use the sidebar search or the autogenerated navigation in this section to jump directly to the setting you need.
