## Configuration

<div className="config-wrapper"><div className="config">__name__: automerge</div>
<div className="config">__type__: int</div>
<div className="config">__default__: 0</div></div>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
// highlight-next-line
      "automerge": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Indicate whether or not you want pull/merge requests created by violinist to have the automerge option enabled.

> **Note:** This option can be used within [rules](/configuration/rules) to enable automerge for specific package groups while keeping it disabled for others.

> Note! This option currently does not work with Bitbucket.

## Explanation

If you want even less work with your dependency updates, you might want violinist to also enable automerge on the pull/merge requests it opens. This way your dependencies will be truly automatically updated and merged once your tests pass!

## Example

If you want all pull/merge requests coming from violinist to have automerge enabled, and automatically get merged once your tests pass, you can specify that like this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "description": "My awesome project",
  "require": {
    "vendor/package": "^1.4.0",
  },
// highlight-start
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
      "automerge": 1
    }
  }
// highlight-end
}
```
