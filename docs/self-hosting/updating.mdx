title: Updating Update Runners
---

We strongly recommend always pulling the latest version when running the update container. This is done by passing the option `--pull=always` to the `docker run` command.

For example like this:

```
docker run \
  --pull=always \
  -e "LICENCE_KEY=my_key" \
  -e "PROJECT_URL=https://github.com/user/repo" \
  -e "USER_TOKEN=ghp_jYgGb_1npvkiHTdnM" \
  ghcr.io/violinist-dev/update-check-runner:8.3-multi-composer-2
```

If you choose to not do that (for example by omitting the `pull` flag, you would typically update the runner by using `docker pull`.

For example like this:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/violinist-dev/update-check-runner:8.3-multi-composer-2
```
