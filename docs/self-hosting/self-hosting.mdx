Violinist.io offers an on-prem / self hosted version of the update runners.

## Advantages

The main reason for using a self hosted version would be access restrictions, or IT policies. For example:

- Third party services are not allowed to be installed in the VCS provider organization (for example not allowed to use a github app)
- Third party services are not allowed to access repository information or contents
- The repository or some of the dependencies in the repository requires VPN or IP filtering to have access

If you are prevented from using the hosted (SaaS) version at [violinist.io](https://violinist.io) for one or more of these reasons, then self hosting the update runners might be a good fit for your organization.
