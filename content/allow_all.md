## Configuration

__name__: always_update_all
__type__: int
__default__: 0

{{< highlight JSON "hl_lines=5" >}}
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
      "always_update_all": 0
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Indicate if you always want violinist to update all packages (simply the command `composer update` with no arguments) every time it runs. 

## Explanation

This is probably most useful if you have not so many dependencies, or if you are replacing a manual workflow that involves this. If you are using this option, only one pull request will be created by violinist, and it will contain the updates that would happen if you were running `composer update`. This means


Strictly speaking, if your composer.json specifies that you want to have the package `vendor/package` in the version range `~1.0.0`, then composer will install all version in the range 1.0.x, but refuse to update it to 1.1.0. Some times this is what you want. But many times, a new version at 1.1.0 will include new features and be backwards compatible. So maybe you actually might want to start using that version instead? This is what the option for allowing to update beyond your version constraint does.

## Example

Say you depend on the project `vendor/package` in range `~1.0.0`. And say the latest version is 1.1.0. And say you actually do not want to receive this update via Violinist. And say your composer.json looks something like this:

{{< highlight JSON >}}
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "description": "My awesome project",
  "require": {
    "vendor/package": "~1.0.0",
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}


To make Violinist stop trying to update `vendor/package` (and all other pages) beyond your specified version range you simply add the following to your composer.json:


{{< highlight JSON "hl_lines=7-11" >}}
{
  "name": "company/project",
  "description": "My awesome project",
  "require": {
    "vendor/package": "~1.0.0",
  },
  "extra": {
    "violinist": {
      "allow_updates_beyond_constraint": 0
    }
  }
}
